# DD2380 Artificial Intelligence

* `/HW1` - Homework 1 in the course covered Hidden Markov models and this folder contains implementations of some algorithms related to them, as well as a class representing matrices and their operations.
* `/HW2` - Homework 2 required students to implement algorithms to be used by a bot playing Tic-Tac-Toe. Most code in this folder was provided by the teachers since the focus of the assignment was implementation of algorithms. `Algorithms.java` contains a implementation of the Minimax algorithm.
