# DD2448 Foundations of Cryptography

This course required students to implement some known algorithms related to the field of cryptography.

* `/aes` - An implementation of the 128-bit AES cipher in C++.
* `/modexp` - Modular exponentiation from modular multiplication in Java.
* `/sha256` - SHA-256 hash function implemented in C++.
* `/elipArith` - Implements eliptic curve arithmetic for the prime192v3 curve in Java.
