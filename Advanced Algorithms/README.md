# DD2440 Advanced Algorithms

* `/project1` - The first project in the course consisted of implementing algorithms to approximate an optimal solution of the *Travelling Salesmen Problem*. This folder contains implementations of a few algorithms and a report.
* `/project2` - The second project was about producing the prime factorization of large numbers. This folder contains a solution using Pollard's Rho algorithm and trail division.
